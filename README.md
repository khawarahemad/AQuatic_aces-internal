### 🛑 Step 1: Turn Off Your Antivirus  
Before doing anything else:  
- **Temporarily disable** your antivirus software.  
- It might block or delete the injector or DLL files.

---

### ⬇️ Step 2: Download Extreme Injector  
- Go to this link:  
  [https://github.com/master131/ExtremeInjector/releases/download/v3.7.3/Extreme.Injector.v3.7.3.-.by.master131.rar](https://github.com/master131/ExtremeInjector/releases/download/v3.7.3/Extreme.Injector.v3.7.3.-.by.master131.rar)

- Download the `.rar` file.
- Extract it using **WinRAR** or **7-Zip**.

---

### 📁 Step 3: Prepare DLL Files  
1. Create a new folder (example: `C:\Temp`).
2. Copy these **three DLL files** into that folder:
   - `AotBst.dll`
   - `cimgui.dll`
   - `client.dll` *(don’t inject this one — just keep it there)*

---

### ▶️ Step 4: Open HD-Player Emulator  
- Start the **HD-Player** (your emulator for running the game, like Free Fire).

---

### 🚀 Step 5: Launch Extreme Injector  
- Open `Extreme Injector.exe` from the folder you extracted earlier.

---

### 🧠 Step 6: Select the Emulator Process  
- In Extreme Injector, click on **Select** (top-right corner).
- From the process list, choose:  
  ✅ `HD-Player.exe`

---

### ➕ Step 7: Add DLLs for Injection  
1. Click **Add DLL**.
2. Go to your `C:\Temp` folder and add `AotBst.dll`.
3. Click **Add DLL** again and add `cimgui.dll`.
   - ✅ Only these two DLLs need to be injected.
   - ❌ Do **NOT** add `client.dll` — just leave it in the folder.

---

### 💉 Step 8: Inject  
- Click the **Inject** button.
- Wait a few seconds for it to finish.

---

### 🔐 Step 9: Log In to the Game  
- Enter your **user ID and password** in the game as normal.

---

### 🔌 Step 10: Click "Connect"  
- After the game loads fully, click the **Connect** button from the tool.
- If a new window doesn’t open or it says "Try Again", just click **Connect** again.

---

### ✅ Step 11: Enable Your Features  
- Once the feature window appears:
  - Turn on the features you want.
  - Done!
